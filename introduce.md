## Who is Cha Haneum as a developer?

> What is more important than. the hot passion is the constant passion. - Mark Zuckerburg

I am [a Frontend developer]() and Korean, working as  [a solo student developer]().<br/>

- I prefer FP than OPP.

These are tech stacks that I can put to good use.
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- ES6
- React
- Vue
- Next.js
- Python

TMI, but my nickname Chebread means Cha Han Eum's CHE and bread is inspired by [Andrew Gallant](https://github.com/BurntSushi)'s nickname BurntSushi.<br/>
It doesn't really mean anything.
