## Who is Cha Haneum as a developer?

I am [a Frontend developer]() and Korean, working as  [a solo student developer]().<br/>

These are my thoughts about programing.
- I prefer FP than OPP
- I hate Vanilla JavaScript because it is too inefficient

These are tech stacks that I can put to good use.
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- ES6
- React
- Vue
- Next.js
- Python

TMI, but my nickname Chebread means Cha Han Eum's CHE and bread is inspired by [Andrew Gallant](https://github.com/BurntSushi)'s nickname BurntSushi.<br/>
It doesn't really mean anything.
